#overview
This mod is to simulate a day and night cycle in Barotrauma.

Europa has a 3.5 day rotation cycle, but the hemisphere always faces Jupiter. 

As humans have evolved to expect a day/night cycle, 16 hours of sunlight with 8 hours of darkness will be used. 

## Human day/ night cycle

During the day lights on the submarine will be set as their standard, and at night they will be less. 

To achieve this a day/night cycle will is implemented based off a game timer, to be able to pause and manipulate the timer a new time loop is created. 

Each full day should be 24 minutes, which represents the 24 hours in a day. 

A small display timer appears on the watch which shows the time of day and approaching nighttime. 

## Europan day/ night cycle

During the 3.5 day cycle of Europa, the day will consist of 3 Earth days of light and 0.5 days of dark. Meaning for 12 hours every 3 days there will be a Europa night mode for the game. 

This night mode will see the random spawn rate for husk monsters increase at a base rate * the level difficulty so scales with the game. These will be in addition to the regular level spawns.
