#overview
This mod is to simulate a day and night cycle in Barotrauma.

Europa has a 3.5 day rotation cycle, but the hemisphere always faces Jupiter. 

As humans have evolved to expect a day/night cycle and 16 hours of sunlight with 8 hours of darkess will be reference. 

## Phase 1

During the day lights on the submarine will be set as thier standard, and at night they will be 60% less. 

To achived this a day/night cycle will need to be implemented based off a game timer, each full day should be 24 minutes, which represents the 24 hours in a day. 

A small display should appear which shows the time of day and aproaching nighttime. 

All lights on the submarine will need to be modified by the game when the day and night cycled begin. 

all lighting components will be locked so players are unable to interact with them. 


## Phase 2

During the 3.5 day cycle of Europa, the day will consist of 3 Earth days of light and 0.5 days of dark. Meaning for 12 hours every 3 days there will be a Europa night mode for the game. 

This night mode will see the random spawn rate for monsters increase by 80%.
